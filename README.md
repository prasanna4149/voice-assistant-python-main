# Voice Assistant in Python

A Python-based Voice Assistant that interacts with users via voice commands, providing various functionalities such as answering queries, fetching information from the web, and performing tasks. This project showcases the capabilities of speech recognition, natural language processing, and automation.

## Features

- **Speech Recognition:** Understands and processes user commands via voice input.
- **Text-to-Speech:** Converts responses into spoken language for user interaction.
- **Web Integration:** Retrieves information from the internet using APIs and web scraping.
- **Task Automation:** Executes commands like opening applications, searching online, and more.

---

## Prerequisites

Ensure the following are installed on your system:

- Python 3.7 or later


### Libraries Used

- **SpeechRecognition:** For processing user voice input.
- **pyttsx3:** For text-to-speech conversion.
- **requests:** For fetching web data.
- **Wikipedia API:** For searching Wikipedia articles.
- **Other utilities:** Depending on the specific functionalities you add.

## How It Works

1. The voice assistant listens to the user's voice command.
2. Processes the command using SpeechRecognition and NLP.
3. Executes the requested task, such as searching online, providing weather updates, or opening applications.
4. Responds with synthesized speech output.
